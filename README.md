# 🌍 Cardano University Onboarding Initiative

Welcome to the official repository for the **Cardano University Onboarding Initiative**, a global education-focused project powered by **Project Catalyst**, Cardano’s community innovation engine. We’re inviting forward-thinking universities and colleges around the world to become pioneers in **Web3 smart contract development** using the Cardano blockchain.

---

## 🧭 Introduction

This initiative is a part of **Project Catalyst**, the world’s **largest decentralized innovation engine** built on the Cardano blockchain. Project Catalyst empowers communities to fund and build projects that solve real-world challenges.  

Our goal is to **onboard 16 global universities** into the Cardano ecosystem, enabling students to be part of a meaningful, open-source blockchain development journey.

---

## 🎯 Aim
